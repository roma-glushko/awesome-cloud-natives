# Awesome Cloud Natives

Kubernetes revolutionizes the way we design and implement applications.
We refer to those applications that were written with Kubernetes API in mind from the very beginning as "cloud native" applications.
This repository collects examples of battle-tested open source Kubernetes applications, so we can learn from them and get inspired.
