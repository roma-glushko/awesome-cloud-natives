# Awesome Cloud Natives

Kubernetes revolutionizes the way we design and implement applications.
We refer to those applications that were written with Kubernetes API in mind from the very beginning as "cloud native" applications.
This repository collects examples of battle-tested open source Kubernetes applications, so we can learn from them and get inspired.

## Auth

- [Ory Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) - OpenID Certified OAuth 2.0 Server and OpenID Connect Provider {Golang}

## Continuous Delivery

- [ArgoCD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) - Declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes {Golang}
- [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) - Open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes {Golang}

## Configs/Secrets

- [External Secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets) - integrates external secret management systems into Kubernetes seamlessly {Golang}

## Messaging

- [KubeMQ](https://github.com/kubemq-io/kubemq-community) - cloud native message queue broker {Golang}
- [NATS](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server) - a simple, secure and performant messaging system for digital systems, services and devices {Golang}

## Service Mashes

- [Linkerd2](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2) - an ultralight, security-first service mesh for Kubernetes. Linkerd adds critical security, observability, and reliability features to your Kubernetes stack with no code change required {Golang}

## Networking
